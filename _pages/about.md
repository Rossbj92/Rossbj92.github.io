I'm currently in my final year pursuing a Master's degree in Clinical Psychology at California State University, Northridge. My main research is at the intersection of social psychology and market research, exploring brand relationships and consumer behaviors. Aside from academics, I've worked in market research for the past couple of years and am currently on the Analytics and Innovation team at a firm in Los Angeles; there, I work to develop proprietary tools based in social psychological principles. I'm also employed at my university in the Institutional Research department using institutional data to gain insights (e.g., relationships between weekend classes and GPA, retention, etc.) for the administration. 

I plan to pursue a career in data science, specifically utilizing predictive modeling and machine learning. I am proficient in Python and R and utilize both in data preparation and modeling for all projects. The purpose of this site is to present academic and personal projects that I have completed. 

All projects can be found in the "Projects" link at the top of this page.
